# Hospital networks

Networks used in the paper ["Assessing the risk of spatial spreading of diseases in hospitals"](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2022.882314)

## Data

Each folder contains the network of one hospital. They are labeled from A to C in terms of size, being A the largest and C the smallest.

Within each folder there are two files:

- network_hospital_X.csv: network edgelist in the format *node_i node_j weight unit*. Links are undirected. 
- nodes_hospital_X.csv: occupation associated to each node.
- units_hospital_X.csv: category associated to each unit.
